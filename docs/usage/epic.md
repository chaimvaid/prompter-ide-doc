## Features

### Epics

Epics are the primary entity for managing long-term tasks related to feature modules or parts of a system. They provide a structured way to group related files and instructions.

#### Key Benefits:
- **Organization**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sections.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Files are inserted as placeholders, ensuring you always use the latest version.
- **Efficiency**: Quickly attach relevant files to prompts without manual updates.

#### How It Works:
1. Navigate to the "Epics" tab to create an epic.
2. Define the purpose of the epic and attach related files.
3. Divide the epic into multiple sections, each representing a specific task or prompt to the LLM.
4. Save the epic to organize its sections.

Each section within an epic acts as a standalone entity, focusing on a specific task or interaction. You can scroll through sections one by one to review or edit them.

When switching to the "Epic" tab, all actions and content are tied directly to the selected epic. You must select an epic to begin working in this tab. Placeholders can be used to dynamically update and insert content within prompts.
