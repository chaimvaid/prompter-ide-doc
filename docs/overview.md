# Overview

Prompter IDE integrates an LLM with your local development environment. This enables you to:

- Load local files into the LLM prompt for context.
- Use Git integration to review diffs, commit changes, or revert them.
- Run terminal commands to verify suggestions before applying changes.


For setup instructions, see the [Installation](/installation.html) guide.
